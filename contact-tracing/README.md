# Contact tracing simulator

This is a very simply simulation of how a contact app might work. This is based on the things I've read and seen and is in now way an save and privacy friendly implementation. Is use this code to explain and teach about javascript.

Any improvements are more than welcome, I have som suggestions:

- Limit the amount of UUIDs sent to everyone by only sending the last 3 UUIDs
- Limit the amount the checking number of keys by only checking frameCount - 10000
- Make people move again after a while
- Make sick people beter and move after a while
- (unfortunatly) Some of the sick will die, remove them from the population.

I'll accept PRs for the above suggestions, any other suggestion is also welcome.
